      <description>THe Lesson in investing One lesson that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned in angel investing is pre-supposing what I would do in a certain situation instead of listening to the founder and what they&amp;rsquo;re planning to do. This sounds somewhat obvious, but it&amp;rsquo;s actually a bit more insidious than that.
As someone optimistic, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see the potential in a product and see how founders might try to seize that potential. That&amp;rsquo;s not going to work.</description>

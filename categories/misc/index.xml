    <description><![CDATA[DataKindSF just got their start and the reception was incredible. There was a huge turn out of people wanting to contribute by using high impact skills for greater good. I found out about the program through their meetup.
What I found particularly interesting about the whole thing was the vast possibilities for improving the ways that non-profits do business.

    <description><![CDATA[Several weeks ago I sent a review of a feature in an app I use called Timeful. This is my letter to that company where I tried to get a better understanding of their motivations for the user experience of part of their application.

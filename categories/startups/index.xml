The Background Last week was my final week at Anyscale. I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed my time at Anyscale and learned so much. I&amp;rsquo;m grateful to the team for the opportunity to work with such a great collection of folks.
What&amp;rsquo;s next?

The Analogy: Snorkeling and Scuba Diving The analogy is simply a place on the &amp;ldquo;surface level&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;going deep&amp;rdquo; that is common in industry.</description>

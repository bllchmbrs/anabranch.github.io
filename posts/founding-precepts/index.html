<h1 id="the-background">The Background</h1>
<p>This week was my last week at Anyscale. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed my time at Anyscale and learned so much. I&rsquo;m extremely grateful to the team for the opportunity to work with such a great collection of folks.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s next?</p>
<h1 id="the-leap">The Leap</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting up from scratch. No co-founder, no team, no funding.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve realized that I crave the challenge. Even being past the &ldquo;last day&rdquo; at work, the energy sits within me to at least try this challenge.</p>
<p>It has taken a long time to come to this conclusion, as it was a long time in the making. But come to it I have and decided that there&rsquo;s no better time than right now.</p>
<h1 id="the-goal-bias-ai-based-bias-lifestyle-sized-online-software-business">The Goal: [Bias: AI-Based] [Bias: lifestyle sized] Online Software Business</h1>
<p>I have, for some time, desired to start my own company. I tried in early 2012, but found better opportunities so it didn&rsquo;t go anywhere. I don&rsquo;t have a co-founder I want to start with. That doesn&rsquo;t mean a hard no, I just need to find someone that actually aligns with the values that I have.</p>
<p>Right now I&rsquo;m seeking to start a lifestyle business.</p>
<p>I want to get to $1M in revenue. Preferably from a saas based business.</p>
<p><strong>Why lifestyle business?</strong></p>
<p>The timing is great for this kind of business because of (a) the internet, (b) AI.</p>
<p>I want to target smaller scale opportunities are going to allow me to iterate most quickly, as an individual. I believe we are in a time of great change and the longer it takes to act (and get feedback), the slower you&rsquo;re going to learn. I want to target small applications so that I can learn quickly, document progress, and share things with others doing similar things in the space.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean a hard no, I just need to find something that I&rsquo;d like to run with for an extended period of time.</p>
<h3 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h3>
<p><strong>Trends</strong></p>
<p>The internet creates opportunity for small, independent entrepreneurs (or shops) to build small, but lifestyle meaningful, businesses.</p>
<p>The capabilities of generative AI, while limited and error-prone, provide opportunity for rapidly iterative creation (in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">the OODA loop sense</a>) of new types of applications and value-adds that were previously cost-prohibitive. Many companies will attempt to solve this general problem. However, there will be a focus on larger opportunities (e.g., VC money distorting the market), and that means that smaller opportunities will be ignored. <em>&ldquo;Lifestyle profitable&rdquo;</em> businesses can be meaningful for an individual while not meaningful for a VC backed startup. [1]</p>
<p>This opportunity window is time-limited as adoption increases and the technology becomes more commonplace (e.g., future is here, just not evenly distributed).</p>
<p><strong>Why me? Why now?</strong></p>
<p>That my general capabilities and experience is a competitive advantage in shipping and building.</p>
<p>That I can prove all of this out in a matter of months and don&rsquo;t require a significant build time / ramp time to be effective.</p>
<p><strong>Why this?</strong></p>
<p>These small niche businesses will not attract larger players because their markets and TAM are simply too small to attract serious competition, as mentioned above.</p>
<p>General purpose tools (e.g., chatgpt) will continue to be powerful and draw attention but if you can use a narrow, competitively priced, tool for your specific use case that provides tangible value, you will use [at a minimum, consider] that.</p>
<p>In short, not everyone is a &ldquo;hacker&rdquo; or &ldquo;tinkerer&rdquo;, some people just want it done.</p>
<h3 id="risks">Risks</h3>
<p><strong>Execution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>That I can&rsquo;t code or learn to code fast enough for the domains that I want to cover (which will involve learning new things).
<ul>
<li>This will manifest as iteration speed and inability to ship.</li>
<li>Resolution: Take a step back, evaluate an educational investment (e.g., training class).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inability to effectively market the AI products. It may be that I build great things, but fundamentally, if they&rsquo;re not well marketed and I can&rsquo;t get people to use them (and can&rsquo;t focus energy on doing so, or don&rsquo;t know what to focus my energy on), then it&rsquo;s pointless and I&rsquo;m missing a lever. This is an area that I know less about (e.g., how to use producthunt) and so therefore it might come up.
<ul>
<li>This will manifest if I launch but get little traffic, repeatedly. I should expect to see variance in the things that I ship and their ability to get users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The core risk that comes from this project is myself and my inner demons and insecurities. This would come about because i lower my standards, accept mediocrity, and lose urgency and prioritization. It&rsquo;s going to come from consumption of media, of information, and not setting proper boundaries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Planning</strong></p>
<p>There is some risk of poor business choice or business model choice. This will arise in several potential ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>A business that is too costly to maintain - in this case I&rsquo;ll either (a) wind it down or (b) sell the business. The emphasis will be on selling it and I&rsquo;ll call this out as risks for the actual projects. A particular emphasis will be put on &ldquo;operational&rdquo; time spent - if it&rsquo;s interfering with other operations or projects (that look to have better outcomes / possibility) then packaging it up and selling it may be the best option.</li>
<li>A business that just isn&rsquo;t profitable - in this case, the evaluation will have to be on (a) is this temporary and represents investment for the future / flywheel building or (b) is this just a bad business (similar to issue 1).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>External Circumstances</strong></p>
<p>Shit happens. If something happens financially or some larger world event that causes me to need money more quickly than I would otherwise. This means that I&rsquo;ll want to take a particularly conservative bent on my family&rsquo;s finances to take this risk.</p>
<h3 id="the-precepts">The Precepts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Shipping and iteration speed trump all.</li>
<li>Do cool shit, write about it.</li>
<li>Showing up consistently is better than intermittently.</li>
<li>Complete but lower quality is better than incomplete with higher quality.</li>
<li>Day 1 profitable (or line of sight to profitability) is the approach.</li>
<li>Bootstrapping and owning the business is superior to raising capital for this class of business (certainly at this time). Fundamental goal misalignment in desired outcomes.
<ul>
<li>Raising capital will be explored if, and only if, there represents significant opportunity is adding more cash to scale operations and that the cash is clearly put to use immediately to solve specific problems - not to raise to raise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-exactly-do-i-aim-to-do--the-next-steps--actions">What exactly do I aim to do / The Next Steps / Actions</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m building/working on two things:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tech proofs-of-concept</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>These aim to <em>educate</em> myself and others on what is possible, the way things should be done, or the options people have when seeking to complete a task. Examples of this include: &ldquo;4 ways to run stable diffusion on your own and discussion of costs and tradeoffs of each.&rdquo; This is akin to a hackathon with a short length to shipping something using available tools and technology - simply just bringing them together to ship something to better understand &ldquo;possibility&rdquo;. This is about discovery, what are the limits of these actual applications?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Commercial Applications</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>These aim to build the entire flow for commercial business and prove or disprove the potential for a commercial entity. The emphasis here is less on technology exploration and more on pure application and value creation / capture. These are intended to bring in revenue. They&rsquo;re intended to be commercially viable or at least for me to understand whether or not something is commercially viable.</p>
<p>These may or may not involve the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;.</p>
<p>These are intended to be small scale businesses and aim to capture immediate and already existing demand (instead of seeking to &rsquo;educate&rsquo; a market).</p>
<p>Commercial applications should be &lsquo;complete&rsquo; in the minimum viable product sense - a user can use it and provide helpful feedback.</p>
<p>They <em>can</em> be vaporware, e.g., landing page to check for demand if the build constraints or challenges are too high, but even these should be directly asking people for money or a deposit - even if it&rsquo;s refunded to the customer or user in the future.</p>
<h3 id="constraints">Constraints</h3>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong></p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t documentation in the conventional sense, this is documentation in the sense that I want to document my hypotheses before I build things, seek to answer questions about the business, about tools, or about the world, and subsequently either write about that or be prepared to write about it.</p>
<p>The emphasis here is on (a) public commitment, (b) showing up in public, and (c) documenting learnings for others.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping</strong></p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m not shipping, I&rsquo;m not learning. The emphasis here will be on shipping things and &ldquo;completing them&rdquo;. This means that it becomes a practice, that there is real urgency in doing something repeatedly - not just idly standing by.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This is a huge risk for me. At least it feels like it. With that being said, I&rsquo;ll learn a ton and move extremely quickly. Cheers to the unknown!</p>
<hr>
<p>[1] Nikita Bier talks quite a bit about this on twitter. Raising VC money sets you on a particular path. It&rsquo;s extremely difficult (if not impossible) to &lsquo;give back&rsquo; the venture capital you previously raised.</p>
